# Canvas Beat em Up Game

In this project I made my first game made with vanilla javascript using the canvas API

## Controlls
WASD/Arrows: Movement

Enter: Attack

## Features
- There are 3 random rooms that change every time the player beats the previous one and walks towards the door
- There is only one type of enemy that has a basic AI, it follows the player no matter if there's a wall between it and the player

## Some comments
There may be issues with the performance because I didn't use delta time
There is a ton of commented code and methods/functions that are not optimized, but I'll be working on it in the future

> Feel free to provide feedback and to edit the code (I left an incomplete shoot method somewhere ðŸ˜…). Now I'm working on a better version but wanted to finish this project journey here to not make it the endless project
